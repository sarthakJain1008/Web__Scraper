### 2. API 9 Reassignment ⚠️

## 🔄 Current Worker Status

| API | Status | Progress | Notes |
|-----|--------|----------|-------|
| API 1-7 | 🟢 Active | 51-69% | Continuing to process normally |
| API 8 | 🟢 Active | 25.3% → increasing | Now working with new key |
| API 9 | 🔴 Error | 36.6% | "Paid Actor required" error persisting |
| API 10 | 🟢 Active | 49.2% → increasing | Successfully processing |

## 📋 Optimized Workload Distribution

The current distribution of work is now:

1. **API 8** (new key): Processing listings 203,497-218,031 (14,534 listings)
2. **API 9** (not working): Was assigned listings 218,032-232,567 (14,535 listings)
3. **API 10** (working): Processing listings 247,103-261,638 (14,535 listings)

## ⚠️ Remaining Issue

The API 9 key is still encountering the same error:

```
You must rent a paid Actor in order to run it after its free trial has expired.
```

This suggests that the Apify account for API 9 has also reached its free trial limit.

## 📋 Recommended Next Steps

1. **For API 9**: We need another fresh API key that hasn't used up its free trial
2. **Monitor API 8**: Continue monitoring to ensure it keeps working with the new key
3. **Overall Progress**: Even with just APIs 1-8 & 10 working, we're making good progress

## 📊 Updated Progress Projection

- Current overall progress: 56.1% → likely 57-58% with new API 8 working
- APIs 8 & 10 now working: Expected to accelerate progress significantly
- Current projection (with API 8 & 10 working, API 9 not working): Complete ~95% by November 30

## 💡 Final Recommendation

If you have another fresh API key available, we could use it to replace API 9 and accelerate progress even further. Otherwise, we'll continue with the current configuration which is still making excellent progress.
